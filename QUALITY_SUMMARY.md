- Feature importance in predictions
- Category-wise usage (building envelope, HVAC, etc.)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Retrain Models**: 
   ```bash
   python train_advanced.py
   ```
   This will generate detailed accuracy reports.

2. **Analyze Feature Usage**:
   ```python
   from data_usage_analyzer import DataUsageAnalyzer
   analyzer = DataUsageAnalyzer()
   report = analyzer.generate_usage_report()
   ```

3. **Test Professional Recommendations**:
   The audit engine now automatically uses professional recommendations.
   Test with the frontend to see the enhanced quality.
